# My personal website
## To use this to create your own website, first knit all files to the _site folder, then copy everything from the site folder into the main folder. All Rmd files should be kept in the main folder and knitted from there. The kitting process will convert all rmd files to html and add them to the site folder. You can use rmarkdown::render_site() to knit everything.
