### Trash is a suite of novel particles with a wide variety of shapes, size, densities, and physical and chemical properties. Studying how trash moves around in watersheds and rivers helps us understand the fate of this pollutant and reveals fundamental insights about particle transport more broadly. All of this research has the ultimate goal of closing a watershed mass balance for trash, which would be the holy grail of evidence that science fully understands how trash moves. We have a long way to go until we get there and I have spent my time chipping away at modeling plastic concentration depth profiles in river flow, plastic concentration discharge relationships, and changes in standing stock of trash along roadways, and spatial differences in trash in riparian areas. 

## Update:
## We published the Concentration Depth Profiles Study in [ES&T](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c01768)
## We published the Riparian Trash Study in [Environmental Pollution](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.052)
