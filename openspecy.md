### Spectroscopy is one of the most important scientific techniques for forensic investigation of unknown materials. In plastic pollution research we need to identify the type of plastic that we find to better understand their fate and toxicity and validate our extraction methods. We use spectroscopy all the time. The best tools on the market for identifying unknown spectra cost $10,000+ and I didn't have the funding to purchase one. So I spent a few weeks developing a spectra identification tool, made it open access, and named it "Open Specy". Now it is used by hundreds of scientists around the world. 

## Updates: 
## -The Open Specy website is [LIVE](https://wincowger.shinyapps.io/spectra/) 
## -We published the Open Specy Manuscript in [Analytical Chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00123)
