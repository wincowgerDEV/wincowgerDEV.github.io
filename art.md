title: Artistic Contributions
---

## Background
Art can be a powerful communication tool and has been used thoroughly to awaken the public about the plastic pollution crisis and science.

## Goals
1. Combine science and art to visualize and communicate truth to non-scientific audiences. 
2. Impact my immediate community through multimedia messaging. 

## Major Learnings
1. Everyone interprets art differently, it is challenging to figure out the right visualization to reach the broadest audience. 
2. Hosting a podcast can be a fun way to get to know your department. 

## Highlighted Achievements
- During COVID I created a podcast series to interview other scholars in my department to keep the department community alive: [Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2IH2x4bpBU&list=PLcpTaL_cR2BL-rkeYG4610v4AgrYK5bd5)
- We created a 3D visualization of how large the ocean plastic pollution problem is: [Facing the Facts of Ocean Plastic Pollution](http://digitaltopo.net/dev/projects/natgeo-oceans-viz/)
- We created a horror 3D film about how bad ocean plastic could get and what the world would be like dominated by plastic: [Current Affairs](https://shuruqtramontini.com/CURRENT-AFFAIRS)
