### I am a Research Scientist at the [Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research](https://mooreplasticresearch.org/). My science focuses on identifying solutions to plastic pollution and assessing their effectiveness. I specialize in assessing fluxes, fate, and transport of plastic pollution in watersheds and river flow. Along the way I picked up a passion for data science and spectroscopy to overcome fundamental hurdles that myself and others in the field were facing in analyzing data. As an applied scientists, I work with nonprofit groups like [Letâ€™s Do It World](https://www.letsdoitworld.org/) and [5 Gyres](https://www.5gyres.org/), government agencies like [Trash Monitoring Workgroup](https://mywaterquality.ca.gov/monitoring_council/trash_monitoring/) and the [Ocean Protection Council](http://www.opc.ca.gov/), and academics to implement science in practice.
